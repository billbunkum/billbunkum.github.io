# William Hurst Web Dev / Infosec Portfolio

## Contents

### Infosec
I am using _Hack the Box_ for practical Pentetration testing and IDS/IPS experience.  

I am also studying for the _Comptia Security+_ certification.

### Web Dev
This is my main [Github][myGithub]. Most of my work is in _private_ repos for the clients with whom I work. Check out these Repositories  for the most **up-to-date** work:  

> [DreadLore][dreadLore_repo]

> [DarkeyesDesign][darkeyesdesign_repo]

## Updates
**10.26.23**  
Revisted _Markdown_ and am updating this README. Next will be to clean up the defunct projects and then curate the site. It's _old_ and needs some renovation!

_02/02/22_  
I have returned! to update this portfoliio.

> As it's my *portfolio* I suppose it's *important*. In my defense, I was either working remotely for various clients or for a proprietary project and have *not* been able to post any of the code.

> I am focusing my efforts currently on a *mobile* project which uses a most interesting language, Flutter.

> In the meantime, I am re-vamping my Github portfolio â€“ it's honestly embarrassing to look at, I admit, but that is what happens when you *improve*! So, I suppose it's a good thing that I'm embarrassed?

> Expect more changes in the next few months...

## Bootcamp
A profile page for the projects I accomplished during the 12-week Awesome Inc. U. Bootcamp which ran from September 2016 to November 2016.

During the Monday thru Friday, 8am-5pm course, all told, I achieved over 500 hours of coding experience just from the Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp. 

Solo projects
Final Projects
* We formulated the idea and coded the project on our own
* Our lead instructor gave us help using Gulp & Webpack
Guided
* We were given definitive parameters and deadlines on what to create
* Problem-solving would take the form of online searches, helping out cohort members and talking through (rubber-ducking) problems with teachers.
Pair-programming
* Random pairs were selected and we were given a task(s) to complete within a certain amount of time (usually 1-3 days)
* We focused on a Git, Trello, Slack work-flow and a Scrum methodology
* Groups would present projects to the class upon completion followed up by a brief critique
Guided coding
* Our lead instructor would walk us through a new technology or tool
* We would match what he did asking questions as we went
* We would attempt to extend/mutate the results
