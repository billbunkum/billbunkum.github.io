#CONSTRUCTION!
+ Bear in mind, I am hot off the heels of our Bootcamp final project and am now re-vamping this site with all the fancy tools I learned over the past 3 months!

# billbunkum.github.io
+ A profile page for the projects I accomplished during the 12-week Awesome Inc. U. Bootcamp which ran from September 2016 to November 2016.

+ During the Monday thru Friday, 8am-5pm course, I was introduced to a variety of current, web development practices, methodologies, languages and frameworks. All told, I achieved over 500 hours of coding experience just from the Bootcamp. 

+ Please, find a comprehensive list of the coursework material [here]({{ site.projects-list }}{% post_url /2016-10-18-projectsList.html %}).
