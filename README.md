# Online Portfolio

## Present Day
+ I have returned! to update this portfoliio.
  1. As it's my *portfolio* I suppose it's *important*. In my defense, I was either working remotely for various clients or for a proprietary project and have *not* been able to post any of the code.
  2. I am focusing my efforts currently on a *mobile* project which uses a most interesting language, Flutter.
  3. In the meantime, I am re-vamping my Github portfolio â€“ it's honestly embarrassing to look at, I admit, but that is what happens when you *improve*! So, I suppose it's a good thing that I'm embarrassed?
  4. Expect more changes in the next few months...

## Past Work
+ I am learning and creating these projects currently...
    1. ReactJS
        1. Tutorial projects
    2. AngularJS 5
        1. ClickRage application (deployed on Bitbucket)

## Bootcamp
+ A profile page for the projects I accomplished during the 12-week Awesome Inc. U. Bootcamp which ran from September 2016 to November 2016.

+ During the Monday thru Friday, 8am-5pm course, all told, I achieved over 500 hours of coding experience just from the Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp. 

+ Please, find a comprehensive list of the coursework material [here]({{ site.projects-list }}{% post_url /2016-10-18-projectsList.html %}).
    1. Solo projects
        1. Final Projects
            * We formulated the idea and coded the project on our own
            * Our lead instructor gave us help using Gulp & Webpack
        2. Guided
            * We were given definitive parameters and deadlines on what to create
            * Problem-solving would take the form of online searches, helping out cohort members and talking through (rubber-ducking) problems with teachers.
    2. Pair-programming
        * Random pairs were selected and we were given a task(s) to complete within a certain amount of time (usually 1-3 days)
        * We focused on a Git, Trello, Slack work-flow and a Scrum methodology
        * Groups would present projects to the class upon completion followed up by a brief critique
    3. Guided coding
        * Our lead instructor would walk us through a new technology or tool
        * We would match what he did asking questions as we went
        * We would attempt to extend/mutate the results

+ Granted, I'm not currently using much 3rd party CSS or weird `mixin` declarations, so there's no need for `vendor/` or `modules/`.
+ I have `sass/` which includes all the .scss files & their dirs pre-compiled by Compass. Compass then sends these over to `stylesheets/` and builds the hierarchy.
+ My current structure (which has been compiled) includes:

***
    stylesheets/
    |
    |-- partials/
    |   |-- _base.scss
    |   |-- _header.scss
    |   |-- _buttons.scss
    |   |-- _typography.scss
    |   |-- _footer.scss
    |
    |-- importer.scss         # primary Sass file

+ SCSS commands I'm playing w/ are found [here in the Sass-guide](http://sass-lang.com/guide).
    1. @extends
    2. @mixin
    3. Nesting (a SCSS technique)
