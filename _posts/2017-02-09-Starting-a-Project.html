    Starting a new project<br />
    <small>What does the project need?</small>
</h1>

<h1>Using Jekyll &amp; Angular<br />

    <p>Super tutorial for doing just what I want without all the fuss - what if you don't really need to persist data?
    </p>

<h2>Jekyll<br />
</h2>
    <p>Great for building static sites that don't do much else that hang out. I've run into syntax problems between Liquid and Angular (in-text) - the browser seems to get confused at times <em>especially</em> if you're attempting to mix and match.
    </p>
    <p><code>ng-repeat</code> tends to go hay-wire, too. That's a b*tch, sirs and madams.
    </p>

<h2>Flask<br />
    <small>
    <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">docs</a>
    </small>
</h2>
    <p>I'm re-learning this beast - the good thing, I remember, is that it uses Python (maybe my favorite language) and renders html to boot in a kinda 'Jekyll' sorta way. That is, Flask makes  a <code>_site</code> folder for all your <em>production</em> files. While it doesn't allow the 'global' edits that Jekyll does, it <em>does</em> provide you a method of being <em>DRY</em> (not repeating yourself with loads of 'already-written' code).
    </p>

<h2>Django<br />
    <small>
        <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/"></a>
    </small>
    <p>It's huge, lemme tell ya, huge. It's the best (sorta), and I absolutely don't need to deal with it for a static site.
