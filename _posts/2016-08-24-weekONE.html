    ~ Git and Github - unlearning what I have learned.
</span>

<h1>Git<br />
    <small>outta my hair</small>
</h1>
<p>
    Among other (difficult) things, I learned a little Dannish today.<br />
    Those other 'things' include using Git in tandum with Github; that means using Jekyll; using Jekyll means using Liquid.
</p>

<h3>UPDATE 11.14.16:</h3> 
<p>
    I now understand that using Git has nothing to do with using Jekyll!<br />
    In fact, as the ebb of time flows ever Westward, all of the technologies we learned in the bootcamp seem to be sinking in much more. Jekyll is a simple tool which allows a developer to create a pretty fantastic, static site and quickly.
</p>
<p>
    I've encountered some fuss when it comes to using Jekyll in tandum with Markdown (a completely other pseudo-language with it's own rules, documentationsss and <em>nearly</em> occult following).
</p>

<p>
    I find myself enjoying HTML more than ever, honestly, and on that note, more <em>explicit</em> coding formats.<br />
    Sure, frameworks are the way to go when coding a massive site, but there's something nice about knowing where <em>everything</em> comes from.<br />
    In my suddenly, post-bootcamp life, it seems ever more important to 1) have an open mind about the 'next big thing' and 2) becoming an expert at <em>something</em>.<br />
    For me, I believe I'll become an expert at being awesome and doing everything.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&#35;STORY OF MY LIFE.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You might see the path where this all went.<br />
    As it is, I have not yet gotten very technical in my 'prose'. Speaking of, I am about to begin reading about <code>prose.io</code>.
