    ~ Transitioning from Python to Javascript.                    
</span>
<h2>Oh my. How I have forgotten Javascript.</h2>
<p>
    At the beginning, I had some difficulties negotiating the different syntax for Python and Javascript. As I become more practiced with these two languages, however, it come easier.<br />
    One last thing about coding: having small children around while you attempt to code is akin to trying to code while a particularly sadistic individual applies a power drill to your temple. Just saying, keep distractions far and away when typing on a computer.

<h3>UPDATE week9</h3>
<p>
    By week 9, Javascript ain't so bad; honestly, I've been told many times before (by programmers) that once 'you' learn (how to use) a programming language, learning new ones is far more easy.

    I'll bow my head and agree with these sages of the digital past.
