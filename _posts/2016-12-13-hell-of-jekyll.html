            One would think that Jekyll would be easy to use - truth be told, it probably is easy to use. There's YAML and there's Liquid. Both are fairly straight forward, not terribly robust, but they are concepts which are eas(ier) to grasp than most.<br />
            I even like Jekyll's official page - their documentation doesn't suck either.<br />
            All that said, every so often, I am just damned capable of breaking something.

            <h3>The problem?</h3>
            In a nutshell, the <code>_site</code> folder was updating <em>exactly</em> what was written in any file in the root folder. That means, that instead of rendering (or, piecing together) all the little bits and bops like Jekyll is supposed to do, Jekyll was directly adding YAML as text.<br />
            That not make sense? Not enough <em>detail</em> for all you Stack-Over-Flow guys n' gals? Lemme break it down further.<br />
