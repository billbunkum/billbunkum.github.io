    ~ How to get a development job after bootcamp

<h2>How do I get a development job?</h2>
<p>
What a darling question, the things one must do in order to procure the <em>dream</em> job in development after completing one's bootcamp program. There are several 

    <em>bloggy</em> 

resources out there dictating how the wonder developer got his job.
</p>
<p>
Let me save you some time and sum it up for you. Do the hustle.
</p>
<p>
Still need further explanation? I shall define what doing the hustle requires of you - apply to every single job you possibly can. That is basically it. Getting the wonder job is <em>just as difficult</em> as you think it will be - which is to say, no one is going to do it for you.

<h3>Harsh Truths</h3>
You might be thinking, 'dear me, that wasn't much help'; in fact, you are <em>incorrect</em>, good sir or madame. It is a good thing for people to be honest with you (especially your mentors at bootcamp). You have to hustle; do not expect it to be easy; keep learning, coding and developing projects on your own (or with others).

It is pretty simple when you think about it.
