    ~ Cross-domain requests

As it turns out, <em>cross-domain requests</em> are a bit of an annoying element of interent security protocol.
</p>
<p>
While I'm not positive, I believe the proliferation of IPv6 will solve several of these security issues with which IPv4 work-arounds struggle.
</p>
<p>
For now, my Date-by-Hate is inoperative (albeit deployed!) - movie suggestions and movie searches are made through a foreign API request; that API unfortunately does <em>not</em> utilise <strong>HTTPS</strong>. What a pain?
</p>
<p>
A few work-arounds have been offered me, the most hilarious being to simply purchase a domain, redirect the site from Heroku (https) on to an insecure (http) site, and run it from there. For the purposes of showing off the Date-by-Hate app, I suppose that is a fair idea; I would like to figure out a more permanent, and secure, way of doing things, however.
