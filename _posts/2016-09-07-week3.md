#Oh my. How I have forgotten Javascript.

*UPDATE:
By week 9, Javascript ain't so bad; honestly, I've been told many times before (by programmers) that once 'you' learn (how to use) a programming language, learning new ones is far more easy.

I'll bow my head and agree with these sages of the digital past.
