    <h2>Ivy Lee Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        I'll be using Lee's method? for doing today's to-do list; we learned about it briefly during bootcamp this past week; I'll mix a couple 'work-flow' philosophies to explain: basically, the most important things to remember when creating a schedule are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Chunking</strong> and <strong>Prioritizing</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><br />
        The next step is to write out, in no particular order, 6 tasks which need to be finished. Afterwards, I'll prioritize the list using whatever logic I so choose to order the operation. The idea is to start on a task and to not begin another task until the current task is finished - this is the chunking part. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sounds simple, right? It is truly simple to get tasks accomplished - that's the super, secret secret. I have often wondered why so many people have trouble sticking to their tasks. Focus and perseverence clearly wonder the same level as virtues.

    <h3>Tasks can be abandoned</h3>
    <p>
        I had a friend who once told me that, at the beginning of an adventure, any work is better than no work. It is sometimes so bloody difficult to simply start doing the thing I want to do. This confounds me as, I find it hard to understand why I seem to find any and every reason to take on activities that I don't want to do, or that I'm dispassionate about, in lieu of jumping into the most exciting activities.
