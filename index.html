This is all about me; there ain't much to say, or rather, I've never been keen on talking about myself. There is no clandestine purpose for such modesty, it's just difficult to explain one's entire self so concisely. I can confidently say the following: I get my <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/user/billbunkum/fiddles/">code on</a>, my <a href="http://dropr.com/willhurst">art on</a>, my <a href="http://intrepidadventurers.bandcamp.com">music on</a>...and the rest is below.
